## Describe your research (100-200 words):

My research falls at the intersection of Game Theory and Queueing Theory applied
to Healthcare Modelling.

I have a background in pure mathematics (completing my PhD in 2005) but now
specialise in Operational Research (with Game Theory and Queueing Theory being
my two main sub topics of interest). My work aims to model agent behaviour in
queueing systems: a direct application of this is the healthcare system where
the various actors in a system have misaligned incentives. This research has a
direct impact as it helps hospital managers to better plan the running of their
organisation.

This research involves a variety of software components mainly providing
numerical approaches to modelling systems and/or data analysis. Recently I have
been involved in another piece of research by creating a game theoretic python
library that reproduces a famed computer tournament from the 1980s. This has all
taken place on github with contributions being made from up to 17 game
theorists and is a good exemplar of open research.

## Please include links to any blogs you maintain or technical writing you have done.

_If you have a twitter account that you use for work related tweets and don't
mind telling us about please include the handle_

I have a blog at http://vknight.org/unpeudemath/ which I use to post about
research, code and pedagogy.

My twitter handle is @drvinceknight.

I do a variety of outreach activities which include:

- Regular (approximately 4 a year) participation in the Monmouth science
  initiative. With a colleague I run workshops introducing secondary school
  students to game theory and epidemic modelling.
- I have run/given a variety of ad-hoc workshops and talks. Some examples
  include demonstrating Markov chain modelling for the approximation of pi which
  is a short workshop during which students use dice as a Monte Carlo simulation
  followed by an algebraic explanation of how this can be used to approximate pi.
  Another example is the 2015 STEM Live event at which I was asked to give the
  opening address to 200 visiting 11/12 year old students. This experience of
  such activities means that I am often the member of staff that represents the
  School of Mathematics at University events.
- Speaking at the British Science Festival: In 2015 I gave a joint talk with
  Professor Glazebrook entitled: Advanced airports on time ambulances and much
  else besides.


## Provide evidence of your standing and/or engagement with your community (100-200 words)

_This can incude up to three impactful publications, software you have
written/contributed to, blogs you maintain or have written for and any other
examples you deem fit._

Within my research area I have a number of impactful publications. One example
of this is the 2013 paper entitled 'Selfish Routing in Public Services' which
used game theory and numerical algorithms to measure the effect of selfish
behaviour in the NHS. My research is well respected in my field due to its nature of
bringing together two separate areas of Operational Research.

As mentioned previously: I participate in a variety of talks and workshops (for
example I spoke at the British Science Festival in September 2015). I also sit
on the General Council of the OR Society and am the chair for the OR in schools
task force.

I have been involved in open source software for about 4 years now, having
contributed game theoretic code to the Sagemath system (an open alternative to
Mathematica, Maple etc...). I also, was on the organisation committee for
Djangocon Europ 2015 and am on the committee for Pyconuk 2015.

One final aspect is the Axelrod library which I started but is now the largest
Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma tournament as well as a free and open Python library
that aims to recreate Axelrod's tournament.

## What do you think of the Software Sustainability Institute and its goals (100-200 words)

_To learn what the Institute is about please refer to www.software.ac.uk/about
and the resources we produce at www.software.ac.uk/resources. Note, a general
exploration of other parts of the www.software.ac.uk websites is also
recommended. Please take into account your own experiences and knowledge of your
domain._

The goals of the SSI are aligned with the underlying goals of all researchers.
Reproducible software is just the first step towards reproducible research.
Getting these foundations set is the responsibility of all who are capable of it
and the SSI has a significant impact on these.

Within the UK Operational Research community, specifically that of stochastic
modelling (the area within which Queueing Theory sits), the use of open tools
and reproducible practice is not common. Simulation models are very rarely made
available and when done so are often a binary piece of software that needs to be
run in a graphical commercial package. Practices of version control, test driven
development and reproducibility are not common. This often makes the research
findings presented in papers very difficult to take at more than face value.

In the area of Game Theory there is a growing base of software that is used (the
gambit package as well as Sagemath) but the community around this software is
still in it's infancy.

These are all aspects that can and need to be improved in line with the goals of
the SSI.

## If you are awarded the Fellowship, what would you plan to do as a SSI Fellow? (100-200 words)

As a fellow of the SSI I plan to emphasise the importance of reproducible and
sustainable software practice within the Operational Research community.

This would be done by two main actions on my part:

- Deliver a workshop on stochastic modelling with Python at Pyconuk 2016. The
  goals of this workshop would be to introduce various aspects of good software
  practice (version control, tests, and modular code) through a particular
  problem familiar to those within the Operational Research community (the
  modelling of a queue). Some of the funds from the fellowship would be used to
  support PhD students, they would be able to attend the Pyconuk conference
  itself, including the science track (put in place by a
  previous SSI fellow).
- Organise, in conjunction with the gambit (the leading
  game theory library) core team a workshop on computational game theory. This
  would take place just before Pyconuk 2016 an bring together game theorists and
  software developers to sprint on gambit and Sagemath. Funds from the
  fellowship would be used to cover travel from the USA of Carl Krisman who is a
  leader contributor to the Sagemath project and whose expertise would help
  further develop the synergy between the two systems.

## What software do you use most often in your work (note: if one is a web browser, please indicate the sites/applications/services you use)?

- Python
- Sagemath
- Git
- Github
- Vim

## What problems do you see in your work where better software would help? (50-200 words)

The main problems relate to the previously mentioned irreproducibility of
common software used in stochastic modelling. If more stochastic modellers used
version control and test driven development this would result in an increased
velocity of research.

Furthermore by using an open source language like Python (or similar), the
models developed would be accessible by researchers who are unable to buy
licences for the commonly used propriety software. Furthermore, some of these
models are used by the NHS, reducing the costs of the software by using more
appropriate tools could have significant impact as well as the benefits of
better software development practices: less bugs could potentially save lives.
